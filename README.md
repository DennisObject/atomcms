## About

Atom CMS runs the website of your hotel: registration, login, news, shop and an admin panel (housekeeping). It has two themes, Atom and Dusk. It works with the Arcturus Morningstar 3.5.5 and Ada emulators.

## Setup

You need PHP 8.5 or newer, Composer 2, Node.js (LTS), and MariaDB or MySQL.

1. Download Atom CMS and run the installer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DennisObject/atomcms.git
   cd atomcms
   composer setup
   ```

2. Answer the questions. The installer sets up the database and builds your theme.
3. Point your web server to the `public/` folder. Open `/installation` in your browser and enter your hotel details.

Keep the site private until step 3 is done. The installer never overwrites an existing emulator database.

See the [installation guide](docs/wiki/1.-Installing-Atom-CMS.md) for Windows, Ada, permissions and production settings.

## Update

1. Back up your database, your `.env` file and your uploaded files.
2. Put the site in maintenance mode and get the new code. Keep your `.env` file and the `storage/` folder.

   ```bash
   php artisan down
   ```

3. Install and build:

   ```bash
   composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
   npm ci
   npm run build:atom
   npm run build:dusk
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan migrate --force
   php artisan storage:link
   php artisan optimize
   php artisan reload
   ```

4. Bring the site back:

   ```bash
   php artisan up
   ```

Do not run `composer setup` or `migrate:fresh` to update. See [Updating an installed hotel](docs/wiki/1.-Installing-Atom-CMS.md#updating-an-installed-hotel).
